# ðŸ“š PROGRAMMING TUTORIALS ðŸ“–
##### By Nevin Jojo

This is a 'library / directory' of all of the tutorials (programming / tech-related) that I made over the years. The goal of these tutorials is for me to learn new programming languages, tools and techniques myself and also to share them with other people who are finding it difficult to get started with these labguages/ tools. As I create tutorials while learning it myself, it helps me ask more questions that I wouldn't have asked/ researched of otherwise.

The tutorial files will be updated when new changes are made. If you find any topics that are out of date, please notify me by creating a new issue with the appropriate label.

Check out my [Gist profile](https://gist.github.com/nevinjojo/) to find other handy-dandy programming stuff.

Share it with your friends, colleagues, dad, grandma and so on. Hope this helps someone ðŸ™‚
